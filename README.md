*About
This code prints all the drawings in model space. Drawings are clustered based on the provided minimum distance to separate two nearby drawings. Each drawing is plotted in A4 size paper as pdf, then exported to svg and png format. The sole aim of this code is to export vector graphics from autocad to word so that the drawings are not distorted.
